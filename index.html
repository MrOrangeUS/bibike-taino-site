        <h2>About &amp; Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Bibi’ké Taíno is more than a neighbourhood &ndash; it’s a movement.
          Inspired by the Taíno people and the energy of Atabey (Mother Earth),
          our mission is to build regenerative communities that honour
          ancestral wisdom while embracing modern, decentralised
          technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          We design self‑sufficient eco‑villages where homes harvest their
          own water and energy, food is grown locally, and decision making
          occurs transparently through a Decentralised Autonomous
          Organisation (DAO). Every resident is a steward of the land and
          has a voice in how the community evolves.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Token & DAO Section -->
      <section id="token" class="container py-5 bg-light">
        <h2>Bibi’ké Token &amp; DAO</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>Bibi’ké Token</strong> is the lifeblood of our economy
          and governance. It acts as a medium of exchange within the
          community and grants holders the right to vote on proposals
          through the <strong>Bibi’ké DAO</strong>.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled ms-3">
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Fixed supply:</strong> To protect long‑term value, the
            token supply is capped. A portion is allocated to the community
            treasury for infrastructure and cultural programs.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Utility:</strong> Purchase property deeds, participate in
            governance, and earn rewards for contributions to energy
            production, food growing, and community service.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Governance:</strong> Every adult resident holding tokens
            can vote on proposals. Proposals covering budgets,
            infrastructure upgrades, and cultural events require a
            supermajority to pass.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

      <!-- NFT Property Deeds Section -->
      <section id="nft-deeds" class="container py-5">
        <h2>NFT Property Deeds</h2>
        <p>
          Ownership of land in a Bibi’ké Taíno community is represented by a
          unique non‑fungible token (NFT) deed. Minting a deed grants you
          the right to occupy and steward a specific plot within our
          neighbourhood.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled ms-3">
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Digital &amp; legal:</strong> Each NFT deed corresponds
            to a legally compliant land contract, stored on‑chain and
            backed by traditional legal agreements. This ensures your
            ownership is recognised both digitally and in the real world.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Resale &amp; transfer:</strong> You may transfer your
            deed to another party according to community guidelines and
            applicable regulations.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Minting process:</strong> To acquire a deed, connect
            your wallet, obtain Bibi’ké Tokens, and mint during the public
            sale. Quantities are limited to ensure balanced community
            growth.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Detailed instructions on how to mint and manage your deed will be
          available on our minting portal once the sale begins.

      <!-- Government Permits & Compliance Section -->
      <section id="permits" class="container py-5 bg-light">
        <h2>Government Permits &amp; Compliance</h2>
        <p>
          Bibi’ké Taíno operates within the legal framework of each
          jurisdiction where we build. Our team works closely with
          authorities to secure all necessary permits and approvals. These
          include zoning and land use approvals, environmental impact
          assessments, building permits, and infrastructure permits for
          water and power systems. Our approach emphasises transparency and
          collaboration to ensure compliance and longevity.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled ms-3">
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Environmental compliance:</strong> We conduct full
            impact studies, adhering to environmental protection laws and
            integrating renewable technologies that reduce our footprint.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Land use &amp; zoning:</strong> Each community site is
            approved for residential and agricultural use. Agreements with
            municipal or county authorities confirm that our off‑grid
            infrastructures meet or exceed building codes.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Legal recognition of NFTs:</strong> Our legal team
            collaborates with regulators to ensure NFT deeds are recognised
            alongside traditional land titles, providing you with a secure
            and enforceable property right.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We share updates about permits and compliance openly. Investors
          and buyers can review documentation in our due diligence portal
          (coming soon). If you have questions about regulatory status,

          Investors play a crucial role in bringing Bibi’ké Taíno
          communities to life. By supporting our project, you help finance
          land acquisition, infrastructure development, and the growth of
          our regenerative economy. In return, investors receive Bibi’ké
          Tokens, priority access to property deeds, and participation in

            <strong>Value proposition:</strong> Token holders benefit from
            potential appreciation of the community and token value as more
            residents join and demand for deeds grows. Because supply is
            limited and the project focuses on sustainable living, there
            is strong potential for long‑term value creation.
