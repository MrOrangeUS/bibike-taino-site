        <h2>About &amp; Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Bibi’ké Taíno is more than a neighbourhood &ndash; it’s a movement. Inspired
          by the Taíno people and the energy of Atabey (Mother Earth), our
          mission is to build regenerative communities that honour ancestral
          wisdom while embracing modern, decentralised technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          We design self‑sufficient eco‑villages where homes harvest their own
          water and energy, food is grown locally, and decision making occurs
          transparently through a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO).
          Every resident is a steward of the land and has a voice in how the
          community evolves.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Token & DAO -->
      <section id="token">
        <h2>Bibi’ké Token &amp; DAO</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>Bibi’ké Token</strong> is the lifeblood of our economy and
          governance. It acts as a medium of exchange within the community and
          grants holders the right to vote on proposals through the
          <strong>Bibi’ké DAO</strong>.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Fixed supply:</strong> To protect long‑term value, the token
            supply is capped. A portion is allocated to the community treasury
            for infrastructure and cultural programs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Utility:</strong> Purchase property deeds, participate in
            governance, and earn rewards for contributions to energy
            production, food growing, and community service.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Governance:</strong> Every adult resident holding tokens can
            vote on proposals. Proposals covering budgets, infrastructure
            upgrades, and cultural events require a supermajority to pass.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

          distribution, and vesting schedules.

      <!-- NFT Property Deeds -->
      <section id="nft-deeds">
        <h2>NFT Property Deeds</h2>
        <p>
          Ownership of land in a Bibi’ké Taíno community is represented by a
          unique non‑fungible token (NFT) deed. Minting a deed grants you the
          right to occupy and steward a specific plot within our neighbourhood.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Digital &amp; legal:</strong> Each NFT deed corresponds to a
            legally compliant land contract, stored on‑chain and backed by
            traditional legal agreements. This ensures your ownership is
            recognised both digitally and in the real world.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Resale &amp; transfer:</strong> You may transfer your deed to
            another party according to community guidelines and applicable
            regulations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Minting process:</strong> To acquire a deed, connect your
            wallet, obtain Bibi’ké Tokens, and mint during the public sale.
            Quantities are limited to ensure balanced community growth.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Detailed instructions on how to mint and manage your deed will be
          available on our minting portal once the sale begins.
        </p>

      <!-- Government Permits & Compliance -->
      <section id="permits">
        <h2>Government Permits &amp; Compliance</h2>
        <p>
          Bibi’ké Taíno operates within the legal framework of each
          jurisdiction where we build. Our team works closely with
          authorities to secure all necessary permits and approvals. These
          include zoning and land use approvals, environmental impact
          assessments, building permits, and infrastructure permits for water
          and power systems. Our approach emphasises transparency and
          collaboration to ensure compliance and longevity.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Environmental compliance:</strong> We conduct full impact
            studies, adhering to environmental protection laws and integrating
            renewable technologies that reduce our footprint.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Land use &amp; zoning:</strong> Each community site is
            approved for residential and agricultural use. Agreements with
            municipal or county authorities confirm that our off‑grid
            infrastructures meet or exceed building codes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal recognition of NFTs:</strong> Our legal team
            collaborates with regulators to ensure NFT deeds are recognised
            alongside traditional land titles, providing you with a secure
            and enforceable property right.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We share updates about permits and compliance openly. Investors and
          buyers can review documentation in our due diligence portal (coming
          soon). If you have questions about regulatory status, contact us.

      <!-- Investor Information -->
      <section id="investors">
        <h2>Investor Information</h2>
        <p>
          Investors play a crucial role in bringing Bibi’ké Taíno communities
          to life. By supporting our project, you help finance land
          acquisition, infrastructure development, and the growth of our
          regenerative economy. In return, investors receive Bibi’ké Tokens,
          priority access to property deeds, and participation in our
          governance.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Use of proceeds:</strong> Funds raised are earmarked for
            land purchases, construction of eco‑homes, renewable energy
            systems, community facilities, and community agriculture.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Value proposition:</strong> Token holders benefit from
            potential appreciation of the community and token value as more
            residents join and demand for deeds grows. Because supply is
            limited and the project focuses on sustainable living, there is
            strong potential for long‑term value creation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Investor relations:</strong> We provide regular reports on
            financial health, development progress, and governance decisions.
